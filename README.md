# RigidBot Firmware

Custom Marlin firmware for the RigidBot line of 3D printers.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open Arduino PDE
1. Go to File>Open>(Rigidbot FW directory)>Marlin>Marlin.ino
1. Make sure your Rigidboard is connected and powered on, the serial port is correct, and you have Arduino Mega 2560 selected under the "board" menu. All these options are found under the "Tools" menu.
1. Click "Verify" to make sure there are no errors and then "Upload" after the verify step is finished.

Note: If you want to make changes (not advised unless you are experienced) then you can do so under the Configuration.h tab of the firmware before uploading it to the board.
